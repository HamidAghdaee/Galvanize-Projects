   		 		<h2>About Sanjeet</h2>		
   		 		<p> I was born in the U.K. and moved quite often when I was young (I even lived in Frankfurt, Germany). I didn't make my trek to the U.S. until I was about 8 years old.
   		 		I now consider Irvine to be my hometown after living there 15 years. Something to know about me is I tend be pretty reserved at first until you get to know me. As for hobbies
   		 		there isn't anything I do habitually. I am a bit more on the adrenaline-junky side so I am always up to try something new.
   		 		</p>
