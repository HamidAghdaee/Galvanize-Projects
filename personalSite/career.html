				<h2>Aspirations</h2>
				<p> After this program I hope to continue my expansion for knowledge of other languages such as Python and Ruby. I love that in this industry new languages and old languages emerge so you need to continuously be educated.
				Hence, it always brings something new to your day to day job routine. From my little taste of HTML and CSS I would prefer to be a back-end developer. Most importantly I would love to work in the car industry. The self-driving 
				technologies that have been emerging have been so exciting to me, and I would love to contribute to such work. I know I would need to learn other languages such as C and C++ to get to those positions. I hope to get my foot in the door at Tesla
				as an IT Applications Support Specialist or similar position and cross over to the ideal niche.
